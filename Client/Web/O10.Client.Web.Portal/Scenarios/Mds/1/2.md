# Root Identity Obtaining. Preparation.
Before starting any interaction with Service Providers you need to obtain a Root Identity to your O10 Identity Wallet. 
For this you need to open Identity Provider at your desktop and your O10 Identity Wallet emulator at your smartphone. 

## Steps:

#### 1. Accessing your O10 Identity Wallet emulator
* First of all, open O10 Demo Portal on your mobile device browser and login there. 
You'll be directed to the page where you'll see two emulator accounts:
